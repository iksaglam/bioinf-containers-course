# Bioinformatics Containerization Course

A graduate-level course introducing reproducible population-genetics workflows using containerization technologies. Students learn to build, run, and deploy bioinformatics pipelines with Docker and Apptainer, and integrate them with SLURM and Nextflow for scalable analyses.

## Tutorials

- #### **Session 1:** [Project Setup and Base Container](tutorials/session_01_project_setup.md)
- #### **Session 2:** [Toolbox & Docker Compose](tutorials/session_02_docker_compose.md)
- #### **Session 3:** [Docker Hub & Apptainer (KUACC)](tutorials/session_03_dockerhub_apptainer.md)
- #### **Session 4:** [SLURM + Apptainer on KUACC](tutorials/session_04_slurm_apptainer.md)
- #### **Session 5:** [Nextflow Mini-Pipeline](tutorials/session_05_nextflow_mini_pipeline.md)

## About

This repository contains teaching materials and containerized workflows for a population-genetics course. Students gain hands-on experience in:

- Building Docker containers for bioinformatics tools.
- Converting Docker images to Apptainer for HPC usage.
- Running containerized pipelines interactively and via SLURM.
- Automating analyses with Nextflow workflows.

## Resources

All session materials, scripts, and workflow configurations are included in the `tutorials`, `scripts`, and `workflow` folders.
